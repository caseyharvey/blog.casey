The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

1.  So baboon this
2.  Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey

## Here is the code

```javascript
"use strict"

const callsites = () => {
  const _prepareStackTrace = Error.prepareStackTrace
  Error.prepareStackTrace = (_, stack) => stack
  const stack = new Error().stack.slice(1)
  Error.prepareStackTrace = _prepareStackTrace
  return stack
}

module.exports = callsites
// TODO: Remove this for the next major release
module.exports.default = callsites
```

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and

- This however showed weasel
- Well uncritical so misled

When she reached the first hills of the **Italic Mountains**, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown _Bookmarksgrove_, the headline of
[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

> The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
> been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
> would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
> return to its own, safe country.

## Here is the code

```javascript
var pSlice = Array.prototype.slice
var Object_keys =
  typeof Object.keys === "function"
    ? Object.keys
    : function(obj) {
        var keys = []
        for (var key in obj) keys.push(key)
        return keys
      }
```

### Thats the end!
