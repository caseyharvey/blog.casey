I have been so focused on completing my portfolio and getting a job. Now that I've completed the portfolio side of things
I find myself in lock-down in a situation far from what I imagined.

### Social distancing has really started to hit me.

At first I thought this was a great opportunity to work on my skills and start building something great. I still feel that
way, I just now feel a disconnect from the world I was building it for. I feel so far away from everyone thats its making it hard to feel apart anything. It feels like being stuck in a strange dream.

Things have changed so much in such a short time and continue to do so an increasing rate. I wonder if the ideas I had before are still what I should be working on or whether i should be rethinking my plan.

#### What can I do to help in a time like this?
